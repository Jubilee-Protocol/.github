# Jubilee Protocol

> **Bridging Ethereum's Programmability with Bitcoin's Permanence**

A hybrid L2/L3 architecture delivering automated, yield-generating index products with unprecedented security and data permanence.

---

## 🎯 The Vision

The blockchain ecosystem is fragmented. Ethereum offers programmability but lacks Bitcoin's immutable permanence. Bitcoin provides unmatched security but can't execute complex financial logic. Users and capital are trapped in silos, forced to choose between ecosystems.

**Jubilee Protocol refuses this compromise.** We unite both worlds through a novel three-layer architecture: Ethereum for security and settlement, a high-performance ZK-Rollup for execution, and Bitcoin for permanent data provenance.

## 💡 What We Build

### Core Index Products

**jBTCi** — The Jubilee Bitcoin Index | *Launching January 2026*  
A diversified basket of wrapped Bitcoin assets (wBTC, tBTC, cbBTC, jBTC) that generates yield through automated arbitrage between peg deviations. Turn non-yielding BTC into a productive asset.

**jUSDi** — The Jubilee USD Index | *Launching February 2026*  
A stablecoin index combining USDC and DAI, optimized for capital stability while capturing micro-arbitrage opportunities between stablecoin pegs. Stable value meets automated yield.

**jETHs** — The Jubilee Ethereum Staked Index | *Launching March 2026*  
A diversified portfolio of liquid staking tokens (stETH, rETH, cbETH) earning dual yield: base staking rewards + arbitrage alpha from the Rebalancing Engine.

### Multi-Chain Strategy

All index products deploy across multiple blockchains—starting with **zkSync Era** (our native home) and **Base** (for deep liquidity access). Each deployment operates independently with optimized rebalancing for its ecosystem, maximizing accessibility and capital efficiency.

## 📅 Launch Schedule

**Q1 2026 — Product Rollout**

| Product | Launch Date | Focus |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **jBTCi** | January 2026 | Bitcoin index with automated arbitrage |
| **jUSDi** | February 2026 | Stablecoin optimization and yield |
| **jETHs** | March 2026 | Liquid staking diversification |

Each launch will be accompanied by comprehensive audits, liquidity bootstrapping, and multi-chain deployments.

## 🏗️ The Architecture

### Layer 1: Ethereum
The bedrock. All security, state verification, and asset custody anchored to Ethereum's battle-tested infrastructure. ZK-proofs ensure every L2 transaction is cryptographically validated on L1.

### Layer 2: Jubilee (ZK-Rollup)
The execution layer. An EVM-compatible environment offering 100x lower costs and higher throughput while inheriting Ethereum's security. Home to our DEX, vaults, and all smart contract logic.

### Layer 3: Bitcoin
The permanence layer. Critical data hashes are periodically anchored to Bitcoin's blockchain via OP_RETURN, creating an immutable audit trail secured by the world's most powerful proof-of-work network. Perfect for compliance, dispute resolution, and long-term archival.

## ⚡ How It Works

1. **Users deposit assets** into ERC-4626 vaults (jBTCi, jETHs, jUSDi)
2. **Rebalancing Engine** monitors markets 24/7 for arbitrage opportunities
3. **Automated trading** exploits peg deviations across wrapped/staked assets
4. **Profits compound** back into vaults, increasing NAV for all holders
5. **Protocol revenue** flows to $JUBL stakers via "Choice Yield"

All of this happens transparently on-chain with MEV protection, circuit breakers, and multi-layered oracle security.

## 🪙 The $JUBL Token

The protocol's economic engine and governance token:

- **Real Yield**: Stake $JUBL to earn protocol revenue (paid in jBTC/jETH)
- **Governance**: Participate in protocol decisions through the Jubilee Council
- **Security**: Required stake for validators, sequencers, and bridge operators
- **Utility**: Fee discounts and access to premium features

**Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 $JUBL  
**Emissions**: Logarithmic decay transitioning to revenue-driven yield

---

## 🏛️ Governance: Mission-Aligned Stewardship

The **Jubilee Council** governs the protocol—operating like a DAO with on-chain voting and transparent proposals, but composed of verified, mission-aligned organizations rather than anonymous token holders.

**Council Members**: Bible-believing Christian churches and non-profit organizations committed to long-term stewardship, verified through rigorous KYO (Know Your Organization) processes.

**Why This Model?**
- Long-term operational horizons (multi-generational thinking)
- Values-driven decision making beyond market cycles  
- High attack resistance (requires corrupting real institutions + massive token stake)
- Reputational accountability from established organizations

**Community Grants**: $JUBL holders nominate recipients for quarterly grants, with final approval by the Council—directly funding mission-aligned work in the real world.

## 🙏 Our Mission

Jubilee Protocol is stewarded by the **Hundredfold Foundation**, a non-profit dedicated to building resilient, open, and equitable financial infrastructure aligned with Christian principles of service, integrity, and community welfare.

We believe DeFi should serve communities, not extract from them. We're building for generations, not quarters.
