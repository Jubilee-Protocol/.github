# Jubilee Protocol

> **The Liberty Layer**

**Jubilee Protocol is an institutional-grade application layer that unifies Ethereum’s programmability with Bitcoin’s permanence. We build automated, yield-generating financial products on secure Layer 2s, providing the tools for responsible stewardship in the digital age.**

---

## 🎯 The Vision: Stewardship Over Speculation

The digital asset landscape forces a **Foundational Compromise** on fiduciaries: choose Bitcoin’s security but sacrifice yield, or choose Ethereum’s yield but accept its complexities. Jubilee Protocol resolves this compromise with the **Hybrid Application/Settlement Model**.

> Assets live on high-speed L2s for DeFi composability, but critical audit data is anchored to the Bitcoin L1 for 100-year permanence.

We are not building another L2. We are building the **stewardship layer** on top of the best L2s, creating a resilient financial ecosystem that prioritizes capital preservation, sustainable yield, and long-term value creation.

## 💡 What We Build

### Core Products: The Jubilee Asset Suite

Our core products are automated, ERC-4626 compliant vaults that capture sustainable yield through sophisticated, market-neutral strategies.

| Product | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **jBTCi** | **The Jubilee Bitcoin Index**: A diversified basket of wrapped Bitcoin assets that generates yield from arbitrage. | Live on Base |
| **jETHs** | **The Jubilee Ethereum Staked Index**: An auto-rebalancing LST aggregator that optimizes staking yield. | Testnet |
| **jSOLi** | **The Jubilee Solana Staked Index**: An auto-rebalancing LST aggregator for the Solana ecosystem. | Devnet |
| **jUSDi** | **The Jubilee USD Index**: A yield-optimized stablecoin index that captures arbitrage from peg deviations. | Live on Base |

### Jubilee Lending: The Capital Efficiency Engine (Coming Soon)

A non-custodial lending protocol that allows institutions to borrow jUSDi against their yield-bearing index tokens at 0% interest, with loans automatically repaid from the collateral’s yield.

## 🏗️ The Architecture: A Two-Layer Stack

1.  **L2 Application Layer (Base & zkSync)**: The high-performance environment where all user interactions and financial products reside. We deploy on established L2s to inherit their security and focus on product innovation.
    *   **Base**: The consumer/retail layer for low-friction onboarding.
    *   **zkSync**: The institutional layer with native account abstraction and privacy.
2.  **L1 Anchor Layer (Bitcoin)**: A "Digital Notary" service that periodically anchors cryptographic hashes of application state to the Bitcoin blockchain via `OP_RETURN`, creating an immutable, permanent audit trail.

**Crucially, we have zero cross-chain bridge risk.** Each vault deployment is an independent instance, a deliberate security choice that prioritizes asset safety over fragmented liquidity.

## 🪙 The $JUBL Token: The Economic Engine

$JUBL is a multi-faceted utility token designed to drive a sustainable economic flywheel.

| Utility | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lending Credits** | **(Primary Financial Utility)** Stake $JUBL to increase borrowing capacity (LTV) in Jubilee Lending. |
| **Governance Rights** | **(Primary Control Utility)** Required stake to join the Jubilee Council and vote on protocol governance. |
| **Revenue Share** | **(Primary Economic Utility)** Receive a pro-rata share of 90% of protocol revenue via the Choice Yield mechanism. |
| **Gas Abstraction** | **(Secondary UX Utility)** Pay application-layer gas fees with $JUBL instead of ETH. |

## 🙏 Our Mission: The First Fruits Tithe

Jubilee Protocol is stewarded by **Jubilee Labs** and is committed to real-world impact. **10% of all gross protocol revenue** is automatically tithed to the **First Fruits Fund**, a dedicated on-chain treasury that supports charitable organizations and faith-based initiatives, governed by the Jubilee Council.
